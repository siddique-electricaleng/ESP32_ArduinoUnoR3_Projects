# This is a guide written by me after collecting information from few online resources to get an idea of connecting the ESP32 CAM with Arduino Uno R3.
## Note: The codes and everything else was compiled and uploaded to the boards using the Platform IO plugin on VSCode. Therefore, anyone using other IDE(s) such as the Arduino IDE, should be able to simple open the main.cpp file and exclude the "first line of code": `#include <Arduino.h>`
